# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
I have no idea yet, I figure I'll write the story and then come up with a name that fits.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
My project is a visual novel that you can play through. It will have multiple choices and hopefully multiple endings.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I would like to make a visual novel/story to play through (made with RenPy). It will tell a story of childhood, I hope, and something very personal to me. I hope to make my own characters, have them talk, and have sound effects and the like. I haven’t started the story so I’m not sure where it will go but it will be something dark. Maybe a little dark. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
N/A


## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
N/A


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my final project would be a story being told. It doesn’t have to have great graphics or cool sounds to fit the theme… I just want my story to be told because it’s important for me to get it out there. 



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be sound effects, a longer, more detailed storyline, and maybe better graphics too. I'm not the best at that though so maybe not.




### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for the final project would be a good well-developed story being told, with good graphics, sound effects, changing graphics for expressions, and maybe even small animations - a creepy smile growing, for instance. I just want it to make you FEEL something. Unnerved, interested, it doesn’t matter what.



## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research RenPy and figure out how that works. I will need to be able to edit photos (that’s fine) and figure out how to tell a good story in a reasonable amount of time - with plot, sustenance, and something that makes it interesting or intriguing. I will do this all on my own because I’m working by myself, not that I mind.

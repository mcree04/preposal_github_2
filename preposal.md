# Preproposal

/ 

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I'm still a unsure about what I want to do. I'll list some things and you can tell me what makes sense and what doesn't work.
Some kind of "cooking" game (bake cookies with a recipe, like you'd see online)
A maze game (run through the maze and get to the Desired Object (with some sort of drawback))
A visual novel (perhaps)

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I don't think I will be working with anyone. 

/

## Do you have any questions of your own?
Not really. I just don't want to talk. Talking is hard.
